# StoryboardExample

An example project that accompanies my tutorial on using interface builder within teams. Tutorial: http://blog.pusher.com/interface-builder-teams/

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repo onto your machine and open it in Xcode. 
There is no code within this example project or functioning segues, it simply shows how you can hook up segues and use storyboard references.

### Prerequisites

* Xcode 9+
